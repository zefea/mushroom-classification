# Final Report

The program needs python programming language (version 3.x+) for execution.

For installation of necessary library, the next line should be run on the terminal. pip install requirements.txt

After this installation, main.py should be run to start the program.

There are 3 python scripts in this project. 

- main.y
- Algorithm.py
- DatasetPlot.py

Before running, 
To be able to run this program an input file named "mushroom.csv" must be at the same folder as all python scripts.
It is provided. 


While running the program, 
Several figures will appear, you should close or save those figures to be able to continue and start training. 
Those figures are given in the report. 
- Dataset feature plots 1 and 2
- Confusion Matrices

OUTPUTS
--------
To save some space, we put the outputs in a folder called "Outputs" and we zip it. Normally it will be created as described below.
After running the program, 
1. it will create a folder named "feature_figures" which incluedes the correlation plot and each feature examination plot. Correlation matrix will be inside of it.
2. there will be a .txt file named DatasetInfo. It consist lots of stats.
3. training&validation.png is the figure for ANN results.
4. 'model artifact' folder is the saved model for ANN.
